# Personal REACT / typeScript todos app to gain a better understanding of typeScript through learning.<br>
### Took me about 4 hours to build this app with no knowledge of typeScript.<br>
### Some blockers I ran into where using date input types which were overcome through some more research using documentation.<br>
### All in all it was a lot of fun learning typeScript basics this way versus reading or watching videos on the subject.
